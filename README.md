Java Variable length matrix multiplication

Introduction

Matrices are amongst the most widely used concept in all fields of mathematics and now are dominantly used in Graphics Designing, Processing, Numerical Method Analysis and etc. Matrices are what lead to the mathematical representation of the Concept of Vector. Matrix Multiplication is one of the most time consuming methods that one could go for. The most commonly used method of Matrix multiplication is Iterative Multiplication whereas the Strassen’s Algorithm is the most efficient method of attaining the vector product of 2 matrices.
Approach

The Java file created consists of a class that allows the user to make an object that has a multidimensional array. This class is populated with functions pertaining to the object. These include the functions for matrix multiplication, initialization and printing. 
How to Run

The java File is to be simply run and given the dimensions for the 2 matrices. Values will be auto allocated to the 2 matrices and results will be provided based on Strassen’s Algorithm and iterative multiplication both.
